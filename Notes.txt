Working Idea:
    Button generates and plays melody 8 notes long, tells user starting note, then asks user to type in the note that were played, if user gets more than 75% accuracy they win, and browser is unlocked, the user is given their accuracy and the true melody is revealed, howver if the user gets less than 75% accuracy, theyre merely told their accuracy.
